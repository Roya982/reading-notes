**You know, recently I've read a book about HTML coding and I wanted to give you the most important chapters in it, and those are : *chapter 1*, *chapter 8*, *chapter 17*.**

And to make it easier for you here you go a sum of the most helpful things summarized in the next few lines

## __*chapter 1*__
* HTML pages are text documents.

* HTML uses tags (characters that sit inside angled
brackets) to give the information they surround special
meaning.

* Tags are often referred to as elements.

* Tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes
the start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes
the end.

* Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more
about the content of that element.

* Attributes require a name and a value.

* To learn HTML you need to know what tags are
available for you to use, what they do, and where they
can go.

## __*chapter 8*__
* DOCTYPES tell browsers which version of HTML you
are using.

* You can add comments to your code between the
< !-- and -- > markers.

* The id and class attributes allow you to identify
particular elements.

* The <div> and <span> elements allow you to group
block-level and inline elements together.

* <iframes> cut windows into your web pages through
which other pages can be displayed.

* The <meta> tag allows you to supply all kinds of
information about your web page.

* Escape characters are used to include special
characters in your pages such as <, >, and Â©.

## __*chapter 17*__
* The new HTML5 elements indicate the purpose of
different parts of a web page and help to describe
its structure.

* The new elements provide clearer code (compared
with using multiple <div> elements).

* Older browsers that do not understand HTML5
elements need to be told which elements are
block-level elements.

* To make HTML5 elements work in Internet Explorer 8
(and older versions of IE), extra JavaScript is needed,
which is available free from Google.
