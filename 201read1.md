Hello guys, how are you? 

I've missed so much

you know, since we're starting a new programming level let's have small **revision** about the most important topics we've covered in the previous level that we talked in about *HTML*, *CSS*, and *JS* :

* HTML pages are text documents.

* HTML uses tags (characters that sit inside angled brackets) to give the information they surround special meaning.

* Tags are often referred to as elements.

* Tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes the start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes the end.

* Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more about the content of that element.

* Attributes require a name and a value.

* To learn HTML you need to know what tags are available for you to use, what they do, and where they can go.

* DOCTYPES tell browsers which version of HTML you are using.

* You can add comments to your code between the < !– and – > markers.

* The id and class attributes allow you to identify particular elements.

* The <div> and elements allow you to group block-level and inline elements together.

* cut windows into your web pages through which other pages can be displayed.
The tag allows you to supply all kinds of information about your web page.

* Escape characters are used to include special characters in your pages such as <, >, and ©.

* The new HTML5 elements indicate the purpose of different parts of a web page and help to describe its structure.

* The new elements provide clearer code (compared with using multiple <div> elements).

* Older browsers that do not understand HTML5 elements need to be told which elements are block-level elements.

* To make HTML5 elements work in Internet Explorer 8 (and older versions of IE), extra JavaScript is needed, which is available free from Google.

* A script is a series of instructions that the computer can follow in order to achieve a goal.

* Each time the script runs, it might only use a subset of all the instructions.
Computers approach tasks in a different way than humans, so your instructions must let the computer solve the task programmatically.

* To approach writing a script, break down your goal into a series of tasks and then work out each step needed to complete that task (a flowchart can help).

* A script is made up of a series of statements. Each statement is like a step in a recipe.

* Scripts contain very precise instructions. For example, you might specify that a value must be remembered before creating a calculation using that value.

* Variables are used to temporarily store pieces of information used in the script.

* Arrays are special types of variables that store more than one piece of related information. JavaScript distinguishes between numbers (0-9), strings (text), and Boolean values (true or false).

* Expressions evaluate into a single value.

* Expressions rely on operators to calculate a value.

* Functions allow you to group a set of related statements together that represent a single task.

* Functions can take parameters (informatiorJ required to do their job) and may return a value.

* An object is a series of variables and functions that represent something from the world around you.

* In an object, variables are known as properties of the object; functions are known as methods of the object.

* Web browsers implement objects that represent both the browser window and the document loaded into the browser window.

* JavaScript also has several built-in objects such as String, Number, Math, and Date. Their properties and methods offer functionality that help you write scripts.

* Arrays and objects can be used to create complex data sets (and both can contain the other).

* CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears inside its own box and uses rules to indicate how that element should look.

* Rules are made up of selectors (that specify the elements the rule applies to) and declarations (that indicate what these elements should look like).

* Different types of selectors allow you to target your rules at different elements.

* Declarations are made up of two parts: the properties of the element that you want to change, and the values of those properties. For example, the font-family property sets the choice of font, and the value arial specifies Arial as the preferred typeface.

* CSS rules usually appear in a separate document, although they may appear within an HTML page.
