There are many reasons why you might
want to add an image to a web page: you
might want to include a logo, photograph,
illustration, diagram, or chart.

*Choosing Images for Your Site*

A picture can say a thousand words, and great
images help make the difference between an
average-looking site and a really engaging one.

# Adding Images

To add an image into the page you need to use an < img > element. This is an empty element (which means there is no closing tag). It must carry the following two attributes:

* src:

This tells the browser where
it can find the image file. This
will usually be a relative URL
pointing to an image on your
own site.

* alt: 

This provides a text description
of the image which describes the
image if you cannot see it.


# Height & Width of Images

* height:

This specifies the height of the
image in pixels.

* width:

This specifies the width of the
image in pixels.

# Three Rules for Creating Images

1. Save images in the right format

2. Save images at the right size

3. Use the correct resolution

# HTML5: Figure and Figure Caption

* < figure >
Images often come with
captions. HTML5 has introduced
a new < figure > element to
contain images and their caption
so that the two are associated.
You can have more than one
image inside the < figure >
element as long as they all share
the same caption.

* < figcaption >
The < figcaption > element has
been added to HTML5 in order
to allow web page authors to add
a caption to an image.
Before these elements were
created there was no way to
associate an < img > element with
its caption.

# Summary

## IMAGES

* The < img > element is used to add images to a
web page.

* You must always specify a src attribute to indicate the
source of an image and an alt attribute to describe the
content of an image.

* You should save images at the size you will be using
them on the web page and in the appropriate format.

* Photographs are best saved as JPEGs; illustrations or
logos that use flat colors are better saved as GIFs.

**Color can really bring your pages to life.**

* Color not only brings your site to life, but also helps
convey the mood and evokes reactions.

* There are three ways to specify colors in CSS:
RGB values, hex codes, and color names.

* Color pickers can help you find the color you want.

* It is important to ensure that there is enough contrast
between any text and the background color (otherwise
people will not be able to read your content).

* CSS3 has introduced an extra value for RGB colors to
indicate opacity. It is known as RGBA.

* CSS3 also allows you to specify colors as HSL values,
with an optional opacity value. It is known as HSLA.

**The properties that allow you to control the appearance of text can be split into two groups:**

* Those that directly affect the font and its appearance
(including the typeface, whether it is regular, bold or italic,
and the size of the text)

* Those that would have the same effect on text no matter
what font you were using (including the color of text and
the spacing between words and letters)

# Summary
## TEXT

* There are properties to control the choice of font, size,
weight, style, and spacing.

* There is a limited choice of fonts that you can assume
most people will have installed.

* If you want to use a wider range of typefaces there are
several options, but you need to have the right license
to use them.

* You can control the space between lines of text,
individual letters, and words. Text can also be aligned
to the left, right, center, or justified. It can also be
indented.

* You can use pseudo-classes to change the style of an
element when a user hovers over or clicks on text, or
when they have visited a link.
