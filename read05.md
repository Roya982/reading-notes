**for today fellows I'ii be telling you more about JS from the book I've told you about last time.**
so to make it simple and fast I'll till you the most essential point about *Functions*, *Methods*, and *Objects* of the **JavaScript** language:

* Functions allow you to group a set of related statements together that represent a single task.
* Functions can take parameters (informatiorJ required to do their job) and may return a value.
* An object is a series of variables and functions that represent something from the world around you.
* In an object, variables are known as properties of the object; functions are known as methods of the object.
* Web browsers implement objects that represent both the browser window and the document loaded into the browser window.
* JavaScript also has several built-in objects such as String, Number, Math, and Date. Their properties and methods offer functionality that help you write scripts.
* Arrays and objects can be used to create complex data sets (and both can contain the other). 

**there is also something  called *Evaluating Conditions* & *Conditional Statemnts*** that is used to make something called loops.

and here is main tips about it:
* Conditional statements allow your code to make decisions about what to do next.

* Comparison operators (===, ! ==, ==, ! =, <, >, <=, =>) are used to compare two operands.
* Logical operators allow you to combine more than one set of comparison operators.
* if ... else statements allow you to run one set of code if a condition is true, and another if it is false.
* Switch statements allow you to compare a value against possible outcomes (and also provides a default option if none match).
* Data types can be coerced from one type to another.
* All values evaluate to either truthy or falsy.
* There are three types of loop: for, while, and do ... while. Each repeats a set of statements.



I hope I was sort of help, thank you for reaching here and see you in the next read assignment, thank you for reading.
