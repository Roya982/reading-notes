The Markdown is an easy way to style the text on the wibsite you've created on the Github platform. What is decorating text style? It's to change the way that the text is shown on the screen, and the crazy thing is that you can do it using small tricks.

See, some signs can be used to creat difrent efficts dipinding on How to use them. for example: the star sign (*), if you put one star befor your text it will become Unordered lest, if you put your text between two stars it will become an italic, while putting it between four stars it will be bold. 

*this is Unordered lest   

*this is italic *

** this is bold **

* this is Unordered lest 

*this is italic*

**this is bold**
