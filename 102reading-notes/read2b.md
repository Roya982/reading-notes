Git is A distributed version control system that stores data in a file system made up of snapshots. Each time you save a changed version of your project Git creates a snapshot of the file and stores a reference to it. 

Every single change applied to any file or directory is tracked by Git. And, as the gatekeeper, Git will always detect file corruption or loss of information in transit. It is set up to greatly minimize the possibility of irreversible damage to files, such as accidentally lost data. Git makes it extremely difficult for a snapshot of your file that is committed to be lost.
