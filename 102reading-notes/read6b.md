Remember when we talked about CSS? 

yup, I've read a book called ***HTML&CSS design and website***, it talked greatly about the topic, and to sum it to you here is the main topics that it discussed:

## About FLASH, VIDEO & AUDIO:

*  Flash allows you to add animations, video and audio to the web.
*  Flash is not supported on iPhone or iPad.
* HTML5 introduces new *video* and *audio* elements for adding video and audio to web pages, but these are only supported in the latest browsers.
* Browsers that support the HTML5 elements do not all support the same video and audio formats, so you need to supply your files in different formats to ensure that everyone can see/hear them.

## About CSS:

* CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears inside its own box and uses rules to indicate how that element should look.
* Rules are made up of selectors (that specify the elements the rule applies to) and declarations (that indicate what these elements should look like).
* Different types of selectors allow you to target your rules at different elements.
* Declarations are made up of two parts: the properties of the element that you want to change, and the values of those properties. For example, the font-family
property sets the choice of font, and the value arial specifies Arial as the preferred typeface.
* CSS rules usually appear in a separate document, although they may appear within an HTML page.
