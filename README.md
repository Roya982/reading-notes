# Growth mindset 
**A Growth mindset** is defined *from my point of viwe* as having optimistic, strong, and willed mind to solve any obsticale that face it no matter how hard it is,**a mind that can _embrace_ the challenges, _persist_ the obsticles, and be _inspired_ by the success of others**.

 - three reminders to stayin a growth mindset:
 1. try to find the root of the ~~obsticale~~ problem when you face it.
 2. think of more than one way to solve it.
 3. if you failed once don't give up.
