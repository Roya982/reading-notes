# Domain Modeling

Domain modeling is the process of creating a conceptual model for a specific problem. And a domain model that’s articulated well can verify and validate your understanding of that problem.

Here’s some tips to follow when building your own domain models.

When modeling a single entity that’ll have many instances, build self-contained objects with the same attributes and behaviors.
Model its attributes with a constructor function that defines and initializes properties.
Model its behaviors with small methods that focus on doing one job well.
Create instances using the new keyword followed by a call to a constructor function.
Store the newly created object in a variable so you can access its properties and methods from outside.
Use the this variable within methods so you can access the object’s properties and methods from inside.
Tables
The < table > element is used to add tables to a web page.
A table is drawn out row by row. Each row is created with the < tr > element.
Inside each row there are a number of cells represented by the < td > element (or < th > if it is a header).
You can make cells of a table span more than one row or column using the rowspan and colspan attributes.
For long tables you can split the table into a < thead >, < tbody >, and < tfoot >.

Functions, Methods, and Objects
Functions allow you to group a set of related statements together that represent a single task.

Functions can take parameters (information required to do their job) and may return a value.

An object is a series of variables and functions that represent something from the world around you.

In an object, variables are known as properties of the object; functions are known as methods of the object.

Web browsers implement objects that represent both the browser window and the document loaded into the browser window.

JavaScript also has several built-in objects such as String, Number, Math, and Date. Their properties and methods offer functionality that help you write scripts.

Arrays and objects can be used to create complex data sets (and both can contain the other).

new keyword and the object constructor create a blank object. you can then add properties and methods to the object

 first you create new object using a combination of the new keyword and the object() constructor function . ( this function is part of the js language and is used to create objects)

 next having created the blank object you can add properties and methods to it using dot notation . each statement that adds a property or method should end with a semicolon

> example vat hotel = new object();

updating an object

to update the value of properties use dot notation or square brackets. they work on objects created using literal or constructor notation. to delete a property use the delete keyword

 creating many objects constructor notation

sometimes you will want several objects to represent similar things . object constructors can use a function as a template for creating objects . first create the template with object properties and methods

 THIS (IT IS A KEYWORD)

 The keyword this is commonly used inside functions and objects. Where the function is declared alters what this means. It always refers to one object, usually the object in which the function operates

RECAP: STORING DATA

In JavaScript, data is represented using name/value pairs. To organize your data, you can use an array or object to group a set of related values. In arrays and objects the name is also known as a key

 arrays are objects

 arrays are actually a special type of object . they hold a related set of key/value pairs (like all objects) , but the key for each value is its index number

array of objects & objects in arrays

you can combine arrays and objects to create complex data structures : array can store a series of objects ( and remember their order ) . objects can also hold arrays ( as values of their properties)

three groups of built-in objects

1. browser object model
2. document object model
3. global javascript objects

 creating an instance of the date object

 in order to work with dates you create an instance of the date object. you can then specify the time and date that you want it to represent
