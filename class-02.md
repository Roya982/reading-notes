hello fellows

lets start with today's reviews 

When creating a web page, you add tags
(known as markup) to the contents of the
page. These tags provide extra meaning
and allow browsers to show users the
appropriate structure for the page.

# Headings:

start from h1 reaching to h6
it's tag looks like
<  h1 ><  /h1>
the smaller number in the tag means higher importance of contennent

# Paragraphs:

To create a paragraph, surround
the words that make up the
paragraph with an opening <  p>
tag and closing < /p> tag.

# Bold & Italic:

< b> and < /b> we can make
characters appear bold.

< i> and < /i> we can make
characters appear italic.

# Superscript & Subscrip:

The < sup> element is used
to contain characters that
should be superscript such
as the suffixes of dates or
mathematical concepts like
raising a number to a power.

The < sub> element is used to
contain characters that should
be subscript. It is commonly
used with foot notes or chemical
formulas

# White Space:

When the browser comes across
two or more spaces next to each
other, it only displays one space.

# Line Breaks & Horizontal Rules:

 if you wanted
to add a line break inside the
middle of a paragraph you can
use the line break tag < br />.

To create a break between
themes — such as a change of
topic in a book or a new scene
in a play — you can add a
horizontal rule between sections
using the < hr /> tag.

# Strong & Emphasis:

The use of the < strong>
element indicates that its
content has strong importance. 

The < em> element indicates
emphasis that subtly changes
the meaning of a sentence.

# Qutations:

The < blockquote> element is
used for longer quotes that take
up an entire paragraph. w the < p> element is still
used inside the < blockquote>
element. 

The < q> element is used for
shorter quotes that sit within
a paragraph. Browsers are
supposed to put quotes around
the < q> element, however
Internet Explorer does not —
therefore many people avoid
using the < q> element.

# Abbreviations & Acronyms:

If you use an abbreviation or
an acronym, then the < abbr>
element can be used. A title
attribute on the opening tag is
used to specify the full term.

# Citations & Definitions:

When you are referencing a
piece of work such as a book,
film or research paper, the
< cite> element can be used
to indicate where the citation is
from.

The < dfn> element is used to
indicate the defining instance of
a new term

# Author Details:

The < address> element has
quite a specific use: to contain
contact details for the author of
the page.

# Changes to Content:

The < ins> element can be used
to show content that has been
inserted into a document, while
the < del> element can show text
that has been deleted from it.

The < s> element indicates
something that is no longer
accurate or relevant (but that
should not be deleted).

that was from the HTML & CSS book and here is the summary:

* HTML elements are used to describe the structure of
the page (e.g. headings, subheadings, paragraphs).
* They also provide semantic information (e.g. where
emphasis should be placed, the definition of any
acronyms used, when given text is a quotation).
