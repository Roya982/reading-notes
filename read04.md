**Today my frind we'll be talking about a new programming language that is called "JavaScript", but befor we start let me give you small reminder about the related subject:**

JS always come along with HTML & CSS, and those are programming languages used to make a website, if we want to explain how do they work we have to mention the *human body* and it's 3 main organ system: **the skeletal system**, **the nervous system**, and finally **the integumentary system**. and while the *HTML* represents the *skeletal system*, the *CSS* represnts the *integumentary system*, the *JavaScript* represnts the *nervous system* of the website.

Recently I've read a book about JS, it's a cool book called:

# JAVASCRIPTJQUERY 
interactive front-end web development.


**It helped me greatly in understanding the JS programming language.here you go the most important topics that was explained:**

__*What is a script and how do I creat one?*__
* A script is a series of instructions that the computer can follow in order to achieve a goal.
* Each time the script runs, it might only use a subset of all the instructions.
* Computers approach tasks in a different way than humans, so your instructions must let the computer solve the task prggrammatically.
* To approach writing a script, break down your goal into a series of tasks and then work out each step needed to complete that task (a flowchart can help).

__*Basic JS instructions*__
* A script is made up of a series of statements. Each statement is like a step in a recipe.
* Scripts contain very precise instructions. For example, you might specify that a value must be remembered before creating a calculation using that value.
* Variables are used to temporarily store pieces of information used in the script.
* Arrays are special types of variables that store more than one piece of related information. JavaScript distinguishes between numbers (0-9), strings (text), and Boolean values (true or false).
* Expressions evaluate into a single value.
* Expressions rely on operators to calculate a value.
