**CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its own box. This box will either be a block-level box or an inline box.**

#### Block-level elements

+ start on a new line
Examples include:
1. < h1 > 
2. < p > 
3. < ul >
4. < li >

#### Inline elements

+ flow in between
surrounding text
Examples include:

1. < img >
2. < b >
3. < i >

## Containing Elements

If one block-level element sits inside another
block-level element then the outer box is
known as the containing or parent element.

# Controlling the Position of Elements

__*CSS has the following positioning schemes that allow you to control the layout of a page:*__

1. normal flow:

+ Every block-level element
appears on a new line, causing
each item to appear lower down
the page than the previous one. 

2. relative positioning:

+ This moves an element from the
position it would be in normal
flow, shifting it to the top, right,
bottom, or left of where it
would have been placed.

3. absolute positioning:

+ This positions the element
in relation to its containing
element. It is taken out of
normal flow, meaning that it
does not affect the position
of any surrounding elements. 

4. Fixed Positioning:

+ This is a form of absolute
positioning that positions
the element in relation to the
browser window, as opposed
to the containing element. 

5. Floating Elements:

+ Floating an element allows
you to take that element out
of normal flow and position
it to the far left or right of a
containing box.

*You can also float elements using the float property.*

+ To indicate where a box should be positioned, you may also need to use
box offset properties to tell the browser how far from the top or bottom
and left or right it should be placed.

# Screen Sizes

## Screen Resolution

+ Resolution refers to the number of dots a screen shows per inch. Some
devices have a higher resolution than desktop computers and most
operating systems allow users to adjust the resolution of their screens.

## Page Sizes

+ Because screen sizes and display resolutions vary so much, web
designers often try to create pages of around 960-1000 pixels wide.

## Fixed Width Layouts

+ Fixed width layout designs do not change size as the user increases or decreases the size of their browser window. Measurements tend to be given in pixels.

## Liquid Layouts

+ Liquid layout designs stretch and contract as the user increases or decreases the size of their browser window. They tend to use percentages.


# SUMMARY

+ < div > elements are often used as containing elements
to group together sections of a page.

+ Browsers display pages in normal flow unless you
specify relative, absolute, or fixed positioning.

+ The float property moves content to the left or right
of the page and can be used to create multi-column
layouts. (Floated items require a defined width.)

+ Pages can be fixed width or liquid (stretchy) layouts.

+ Designers keep pages within 960-1000 pixels wide,
and indicate what the site is about within the top 600
pixels (to demonstrate its relevance without scrolling).

+ Grids help create professional and flexible designs.

+ CSS Frameworks provide rules for common tasks.

+ You can include multiple CSS files in one page.
