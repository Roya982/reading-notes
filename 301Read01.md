Responsive web design is broken down into three main components:

* flexible layouts

* media queries

* flexible media

## Flexible Layouts

Building the layout of a website with a flexible grid, capable of dynamically resizing to any width. Flexible grids are built using relative length units, most commonly percentages or em units.

## Flexible Grid

Take all of the fixed units of length and turn them into relative units. Taking the flexible layout concept, and formula, and reapplying it to all parts of a grid will create a completely dynamic website, scaling to every viewport size.

## Media Queries

Provide the ability to specify different styles for individual browser and device circumstances. Being able to apply uniquely targeted styles opens up a world of opportunity and leverage to responsive web design.

### Initializing Media Queries

Each media query may include a media type followed by one or more expressions.The HTML5 specification includes new media types, even including 3d-glasses.

When a media feature and value allocate to true, the styles are applied. If the media feature and value allocate to false the styles are ignored.

### Logical Operators in Media Queries

There are three different logical operators available for use within media queries, including and, not, and only. Using the and logical operator within a media query allows an extra condition to be added, making sure that a browser or devices does both a, b, c, and so forth. Multiple individual media queries can be comma separated, acting as an unspoken or operator.

### Media Features in Media Queries

Knowing the media query syntax and how logical operators work is a great introduction to media queries but the true work comes with media features.

### Height & Width Media Features

The height and width may be found by using the height and width media features. Each of these media features may then also be prefixed with the min or max qualifiers, building a feature such as min-width or max-width. The height and width features are based off the height and width of the viewport rendering area, the browser window for example. Values for these height and width media features may be any length unit, relative or absolute.

### Orientation Media Feature

The landscape mode is triggered when the display is wider than taller, and the portrait mode is triggered when the display is taller than wider. This media feature plays a large part with mobile devices.

### Aspect Ratio Media Features

The min and max prefixes are available to use with the different aspect ratio features, identifying a ratio above or below that of which is stated.

The first integer identifies the width in pixels while the second integer identifies the height in pixels.
