In the beginning, there was only Internet Explorer. 

userData allows web pages to store up to 64 KB of data per domain, in a hierarchical XML-based structure.  IE does not present any form of permissions dialog, and there is no allowance for increasing the amount of storage available.

In 2002, Adobe introduced a feature in Flash 6 that gained the unfortunate and misleading name of “Flash cookies.” Briefly, it allows Flash objects to store up to 100 KB of data per domain.

Brad Neuberg developed an early prototype of a Flash-to-JavaScript bridge called AMASS but it was limited by some of Flash’s design quirks.  By 2006, with the advent of ExternalInterface in Flash 8, accessing LSOs from JavaScript became an order of magnitude easier and faster.

In 2007, Google launched Gears, an open source browser plugin aimed at providing additional capabilities in browsers. Gears provides an API to an embedded SQL database based on SQLite. 

# HTML5 Storage

+ It is a specification named Web Storage, which was at one time part of the HTML5 specification proper, but was split out into its own specification for uninteresting political reasons. 

+ it’s a way for web pages to store named key/value pairs locally, within the client web browser. this data persists even after you navigate away from the web site, close your browser tab, exit your browser, or what have you. 

HTML5 Storage is based on named key/value pairs. You store data based on a named key, then you can retrieve that data with the same key. The named key is a string. The data can be any type supported by JavaScript, including strings, Booleans, integers, or floats.

interface Storage {

  getter any getItem(in DOMString key);

  setter creator void setItem(in DOMString key, in any data);

};

Calling setItem() with a named key that already exists will silently overwrite the previous value. Calling getItem() with a non-existent key will return null rather than throw an exception.

Like other JavaScript objects, you can treat the localStorage object as an associative array. Instead of using the getItem() and setItem() methods, you can simply use square brackets.

it also could be rewritten to use square bracket syntax instead.

There are also methods for removing the value for a given named key, and clearing the entire storage area :

interface Storage {

  deleter void removeItem(in DOMString key);

  void clear();

};

Finally, there is a property to get the total number of values in the storage area, and to iterate through all of the keys by index

interface Storage {

  readonly attribute unsigned long length;

  getter DOMString key(in unsigned long index);

};

If you want to keep track programmatically of when the storage area changes, you can trap the storage event. The storage event is fired on the window object whenever setItem(), removeItem(), or clear() is called and actually changes something.

The storage event is supported everywhere the localStorage object is supported, which includes Internet Explorer 8. IE 8 does not support the W3C standard addEventListener. Therefore, to hook the storage event, you’ll need to check which event mechanism the browser supports.

if (window.addEventListener) {

  window.addEventListener("storage", handle_storage, false);

} else {

  window.attachEvent("onstorage", handle_storage);

};

*The handle_storage callback function will be called with a StorageEvent object, except in Internet Explorer where the event object is stored in window.event.*
