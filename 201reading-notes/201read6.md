# WHAT IS AN OBJECT?

It ia a set of variables and functions to create a model
of a something you would recognize from the real world. In an object,
variables and functions take on new names. 

This object represents a hotel. It has five properties and one method.
The object is in curly braces. It is stored in a variable called hotel . 

# CREATING AN OBJECT:

## Literal Notation

+ The object is the curly braces and their contents.

+ The object is stored in variable called hotel, so you would refer to it as the hotel object.

+ Separate each key from its value using a colon.

+ Separate each property and method with a comma(but not after the last value).

# ACCESSING AN OBJECT AND DOT NOTATION

+ To access a property or method of an object you use the name of the object, followed by a period, then the name of the property or method you want to access. This is known as dot notation.

+ The period is known as the member operator. The property or method on its right is a member of the object on its left. 

# CREATING AN OBJECT:

## Constructor Notation

+ The new keyword & the object constructor create a blank object.

+ You can then add properties and methods to the object.

+ First, you create a new object using combination of the new keyword and the objects() constructor function. Next, having created the blank object, you can add properties and methods to it using dot notation. Each statement that adds a property or method should end with semicolon.

# UPDATING AN OBJECT

+ To update the value of properties, use dot notation or square brackets. They work on objects created using literal or constructor notation. To delete a property, use the delete keyword.

**The Document Object Model (DOM) specifies how browsers should create a model of an HTML page and how JavaScript can access and update the contents of a web page while it is in the browser window.** 

+ The browser represents the page using a DOM tree.

+ DOM trees have four types of nodes: document nodes,
element nodes, attribute nodes, and text nodes.

+ You can select element nodes by their id or cl ass
attributes, by tag name, or using CSS selector syntax.

+ Whenever a DOM query can return more than one
node, it will always return a Nadel i st.

+ From an element node, you can access and update its
content using properties such as textContent and
i nnerHTML or using DOM manipulation techniques.

+ An element node can contain multiple text nodes and
child elements that are siblings of each other.

+ In older browsers, implementation of the DOM is
inconsistent (and is a popular reason for using jQuery).
Browsers offer tools for viewing the DOM tree .
