hello fellows

lets start with today's reviews 

When creating a web page, you add tags
(known as markup) to the contents of the
page. These tags provide extra meaning
and allow browsers to show users the
appropriate structure for the page.

# Headings:

start from h1 reaching to h6
it's tag looks like
<  h1 ><  /h1>
the smaller number in the tag means higher importance of contennent

# Paragraphs:

To create a paragraph, surround
the words that make up the
paragraph with an opening <  p>
tag and closing < /p> tag.

# Bold & Italic:

< b> and < /b> we can make
characters appear bold.

< i> and < /i> we can make
characters appear italic.

# Superscript & Subscrip:

The < sup> element is used
to contain characters that
should be superscript such
as the suffixes of dates or
mathematical concepts like
raising a number to a power.

The < sub> element is used to
contain characters that should
be subscript. It is commonly
used with foot notes or chemical
formulas

# White Space:

When the browser comes across
two or more spaces next to each
other, it only displays one space.

# Line Breaks & Horizontal Rules:

 if you wanted
to add a line break inside the
middle of a paragraph you can
use the line break tag < br />.

To create a break between
themes — such as a change of
topic in a book or a new scene
in a play — you can add a
horizontal rule between sections
using the < hr /> tag.

# Strong & Emphasis:

The use of the < strong>
element indicates that its
content has strong importance. 

The < em> element indicates
emphasis that subtly changes
the meaning of a sentence.

# Qutations:

The < blockquote> element is
used for longer quotes that take
up an entire paragraph. w the < p> element is still
used inside the < blockquote>
element. 

The < q> element is used for
shorter quotes that sit within
a paragraph. Browsers are
supposed to put quotes around
the < q> element, however
Internet Explorer does not —
therefore many people avoid
using the < q> element.

# Abbreviations & Acronyms:

If you use an abbreviation or
an acronym, then the < abbr>
element can be used. A title
attribute on the opening tag is
used to specify the full term.

# Citations & Definitions:

When you are referencing a
piece of work such as a book,
film or research paper, the
< cite> element can be used
to indicate where the citation is
from.

The < dfn> element is used to
indicate the defining instance of
a new term

# Author Details:

The < address> element has
quite a specific use: to contain
contact details for the author of
the page.

# Changes to Content:

The < ins> element can be used
to show content that has been
inserted into a document, while
the < del> element can show text
that has been deleted from it.

The < s> element indicates
something that is no longer
accurate or relevant (but that
should not be deleted).

that was from the HTML & CSS book and here is the summary:

* HTML elements are used to describe the structure of
the page (e.g. headings, subheadings, paragraphs).
* They also provide semantic information (e.g. where
emphasis should be placed, the definition of any
acronyms used, when given text is a quotation).

*lets check out the JavaScript book*

# STATEMENTS :

A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow one-by-one.
Each individual instruction or step is known as a statement.
Statements should end with a semicolon. 

# COMMENTS :

You should write comments to explain what your code does.
They help make your code easier to read and understand.
This can help you and others who read your code. 

# WHAT IS A VARIABLE? 

A script will have to temporarily
store the bits of information it
needs to do its job. It can store this
data in variables

A variable is a good name for this
concept because the data stored
in a variable can change (or vary)
each time a script runs.

# HOW TO DECLARE THE VARIABLES?

befor you can use variable, you need to announce that you want to use it.

**var** *variable name*

# HOW TO ASSIGN A VALUE TTO VARIABLES?

**variable name** = *variable value*

# DATA TYPES 

JavaScript distinguishes between numbers,
strings, and true or false values known as
Booleans. 

# ARRAYS 

An array is a special type of variable. It doesn't
just store one value; it stores a list of values. 

# CREATING AN ARRAY

**var** *variable name* = [ more than one value separated by ( , ) and written between ( "" ) ]

# EXPRESSIONS

An expression evaluates into (results in) a single value. Broadly speaking
there are two types of expressions and there is two types of it. 

* EXPRESSIONS THAT JUST ASSIGN A
VALUE TO A VARIABLE 

* EXPRESSIONS THAT USE TWO OR
MORE VALUES TO RETURN A
SINGLE VALUE 

# OPERATORS 

Expressions rely on things called operators; they allow programmers to
create a single value from one or more values. 

# ARITHMETI C OPERATORS 

| ( + ) | Adds one value to another |
|-------|---------------------------|
| ( - ) | Subtracts one value from another |
| ( / ) | Divides two values|
| ( * ) | Multiplies two values using an asterisk |
| ( ++ ) | Adds one to the current number |
| ( -- ) | Subtracts one from the current number |
| ( % ) | Divides two values and returns the remainder |

# STRING OPERATOR 

There is just one string operator: the+ symbol.
It is used to join the strings on either side of it. 

here is the summary:

* A script is made up of a series of statements. Each
statement is like a step in a recipe.

* Scripts contain very precise instructions. For example,
you might specify that a value must be remembered
before creating a calculation using that value.

* Variables are used to temporarily store pieces of
information used in the script.

* Arrays are special types of variables that store more
than one piece of related information.

* JavaScript distinguishes between numbers (0-9),
strings (text), and Boolean values (true or false).

* Expressions evaluate into a single value.

* Expressions rely on operators to calculate a value.
