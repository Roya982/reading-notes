Links are the defining feature of the web
because they allow you to move from
one web page to another.

Links are created using the < a > element :

< a href="http://www.imdb.com">IMDB< /a>

The value of the
href attribute is the page that
you want people to go to when
they click on the link.

# Linking to Other Pages on the Same Site

When you are linking to other
pages within the same site,
you do not need to specify the
domain name in the URL. You
can use a shorthand known as a
relative URL

If all the pages of the site are in
the same folder, then the value
of the href attribute is just the
name of the file.

# Email Links

## mailto:

To create a link that starts up
the user's email program and
addresses an email to a specified
email address, you use the < a >
element. However, this time the
value of the href attribute starts
with mailto: and is followed by
the email address you want the
email to be sent to.

# Opening Links in a New Window

## target

If you want a link to open in a
new window, you can use the
target attribute on the opening
< a > tag. The value of this
attribute should be _blank

# Linking to a Specific Part of the Same Page

Before you can link to a specific
part of a page, you need to
identify the points in the page
that the link will go to. You do
this using the id attribute (which
can be used on every HTML
element).

# Linking to a Specific Part of Another Page

As long as the page you are
linking to has id attributes that
identify specific parts of the
page, you can simply add the
same syntax to the end of the
link for that page.

# Summary

* Links are created using the < a > element.

* The < a > element uses the href attribute to indicate
the page you are linking to.

* If you are linking to a page within your own site, it is
best to use relative links rather than qualified URLs.

* You can create links to open email programs with an
email address in the "to" field.

* You can use the id attribute to target elements within
a page that can be linked to.

# LAYOUT

* < div > elements are often used as containing elements
to group together sections of a page.

* Browsers display pages in normal flow unless you
specify relative, absolute, or fixed positioning.

* The float property moves content to the left or right
of the page and can be used to create multi-column
layouts. (Floated items require a defined width.)

* Pages can be fixed width or liquid (stretchy) layouts.

* Designers keep pages within 960-1000 pixels wide,
and indicate what the site is about within the top 600
pixels (to demonstrate its relevance without scrolling).

* Grids help create professional and flexible designs.

* CSS Frameworks provide rules for common tasks.

* You can include multiple CSS files in one page.

# 6 Reasons for Pair Programming

* Greater efficiency

* Engaged collaboration

* Learning from fellow students

* Social skills

* Job interview readiness

* Work environment readiness

**Browsers require very detailed instructions about what we want them to do. Therefore, complex scripts can run to hundreds (even thousands) of lines. Programmers use functions, methods, and objects to organize their code.**
