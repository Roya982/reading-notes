# Javascript Templating

It is a fast and efficient technique to render client-side view templates with Javascript by using a JSON data source. It is HTML markup, with added templating tags that will either insert variables or run programming logic.

## Mustache

Mustache is a logic-less template syntax. It can be used for anything. It works by expanding tags in a template using values provided in a hash or object.

It is often referred to as “logic-less” because there are no if statements, else clauses, or for loops. Instead, there are only tags. 

Mustache is a specification for a templating language. In general, we would write templates according to the Mustache specification, and it can then be compiled by a templating engine to be rendered to create an output.

# Flexbox

inline or block depending on the given value. It enables a flex context for all its direct children.

By default, flex items are laid out in the source order. However, the order property controls the order in which they appear in the flex container.

This establishes the main-axis, thus defining the direction flex items are placed in the flex container. Flexbox is (aside from optional wrapping) a single-direction layout concept:

+ row (default): left to right in ltr; right to left in rtl
+ row-reverse: right to left in ltr; left to right in rtl
+ column: same as row but top to bottom
+ column-reverse: same as row-reverse but bottom to top

![flex3](https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/flex-wrap.svg)

By default, flex items will all try to fit onto one line. You can change that and allow the items to wrap as needed with this property.

+ nowrap (default): all flex items will be on one line.
+ wrap: flex items will wrap onto multiple lines, from top to bottom.
+ wrap-reverse: flex items will wrap onto multiple lines from bottom to top.
