# Heroku Deployment

## Node 

***Node.js*** is an open source, cross-platform runtime environment, which allows you to build server-side and networking applications.  It's written in JavaScript and can be run within the Node.js runtime on any platform. 

* ***It's a web server and not just a piece of code that returns a single line of text.***

* Node provides you with non-blocking and event-driven behavior.


<!-- + $.post('/some_requested_resource', function(data) {

  console.log(data);

    });

+ This code performs a request for some resource. When the response comes back, an anonymous function is called. It contains the argument data, which is the data received from that request. -->

*  Node allows you to use the so-called event loop, which works faster because of non-blocking behavior.

## Heroku

Heroku is a cloud platform as a service (cool long-bearded programmer guys call such type of things "PaaS"). It allows you to deploy your web server, so everyone could see how awesome you are as a web developer.

+ http = require("http") : will give you the key to Node's HTTP functionality.

+ fs = require("fs") : possibility to interact with the file system. 

+ path = require("path") : allows you to handle file paths.

+ mime = require("mime") : allows you to determine a file's MIME-type.

To git done with the project and upload it online :

+ Open your terminal and run the next :

+ git init  (Empty Git repository will be initialized in .git/ folder.)

+ git add . (This command allows Git to track your files changes.)

+ git commit -m "your commit" 

+ *We'll create our first Heroku application now:*

+ heroku create (Heroku will generate a random name for your application.)

+ git push heroku main (Now we can deploy our project. Every Heroku app starts with no branches and no code)

+ git push heroku main (The application is now deployed)

+ heroku ps:scale web=1 (Ensure that at least one instance of the app is running)

+ heroku apps:rename yourServerName (choose a proper name for our first creation.)

+ heroku open (This command will open your Heroku project in your web browser.)
