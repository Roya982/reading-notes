# How does pair programming work?

It involves two roles: the Driver and the Navigator.

+ The Driver : the programmer who is typing and the only one whose hands are on the keyboard.

+ The Navigator : who uses their words to guide the Driver but does not provide any direct input to the computer.

# Why pair program?

there are four fundamental skills that help anyone learn a new language:

+ Listening

+ Speaking

+ Reading

+ Writing

Pair programming touches on all four skills: developers explain out loud what the code should do, listen to others’ guidance, read code that others have written, and write code themselves.

1. Greater efficiency

Research indicates that pair programing takes slightly longer, but produces higher-quality code that doesn’t require later effort in troubleshooting and debugging 

2. Engaged collaboration

It is harder to procrastinate or get off track when someone else is relying on you to complete the work.

3. Learning from fellow students

The less experienced developer benefits from the experienced developer’s knowledge and guidance, and thelatter benefits from explaining the topic in their own words, further solidifying their own understanding.

4. Social skills

This has long-term career impacts. As much as employers want strong programmers, they know it’s essential to hire people who can work well with others.

5. Job interview readiness

A common step in many interview processes involves pair programming between a current employee and an applicant, either in person or through a shared screen.

For most roles, the ability to work with and learn from others and stellar communication skills are as important to a company than specific technical skills.

6. Work environment readiness

Many companies that utilize pair programing expect to train fresh hires from CS-degree programs on how they operate to actually deliver a product.
