## How does the web ?

+  HTTP, it's capable of all sorts of neat stuff that people ignore for some reason. That first part tells the browser what protocol to use. That stuff you type in there is one of the most important breakthroughs in the history of computing.

+ HTTP is capable of describing the location of something anywhere in the world from anywhere in the world. It's the foundation of the web. You can think of it like GPS coordinates for knowledge and information.

+ The whole world wide web is built on an architectural style called “REST”. REST provides a definition of a “resource”, which is what those things point to.

+  A web page is a “representation” of a resource. Resources are just concepts. URLs--those things that you type into the browser. URLs tell the browser that there's a concept somewhere. A browser can then go ask for a specific representation of the concept. Specifically, the browser asks for the web page representation of the concept.

+ Representations is one of these things that doesn't get used a lot. In most cases, a resource has only a single representation. But we're hoping that representations will be used more in the future because there's a bunch of new formats popping up all over the place.

+ Computers can use those same protocols to send messages back and forth to each other. None of the techniques used today work well when you need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the entire world.

+  We need to be able to talk to all machines about all the stuff that's on all the other machines. So we need some way of having one machine tell another machine about a resource that might be on yet another machine.

## How do the machines tell each other where things are?

+ The URL. If everything that machines need to talk about has a corresponding URL, you've created the machine equivalent of a noun.

+ why the URL is so important? Machines don't have a universal noun - that's why they *suck*. Every programming language, database, or other kind of system has a different way of talking about nouns.

+  Verbs are important. There's a powerful concept in programming and CS theory called “polymorphism”. ***That's a geeky way of saying that different nouns can have the same verb applied to them.***

+  HTTP—this protocol Fielding and his friends created—is all about applying verbs to nouns. For instance, when you go to a web page, the browser does an HTTP GET on the URL you type in and back comes a web page.

+ The web page just specifies the URLs to the images and the browser goes and does more GETs using the HTTP protocol on them until all the resources are obtained and the web page is displayed. But the important thing here is that very different kinds of nouns can be treated the same. Whether the noun is an image, text, video, an mp3, a slideshow, whatever. I can GET all of those things the same way given a URL.

+ The nouns are there but not in the right format. Think about when you're browsing around amazon.com looking for things to buy anything. Each of the products as being nouns. Now, if they were available in a representation that a machine could understand, you could do a lot of neat things.

##  Why can't a machine understand a normal web page?

+  Because web pages are designed to be understood by people. A machine doesn't care about layout and styling. Machines basically just need the data. Ideally, every URL would have a human readable and a machine readable representation. When a machine GETs the resource, it will ask for the machine readable one. When a browser GETs a resource for a human, it will ask for the human readable one.

+ Each of the systems would retrieve information from each other using a simple HTTP GET. If one system needs to add something to another system, it would use an HTTP POST. If a system wants to replace something in another system, it uses an HTTP PUT, or, to do a partial update, it'll hopefully use PATCH. The only thing left to figure out is what the data models should look like.

+  Nouns weren't universal and verbs weren't polymorphic. They basically ignored throwing out decades of real field usage and proven technique and kept starting over with something that looks a lot like other systems that have failed in the past. They used HTTP but only because it let them talk to our network and security people less.
